# MyProject

Welcome to MyProject! This repository contains both the frontend and backend code for the MyProject task, which involves developing a full-stack React to-do list application.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the frontend.

6. To run the backend, navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

7. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

8. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory with the required variables (e.g., `PORT`, `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`).

9. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running locally. You can access both the frontend and backend parts of the application at their respective URLs.

## Development

- The frontend code is located in the `frontend` folder.
- The backend code is located in the `backend` folder.

Feel free to customize and modify the code according to your requirements. Contributions are welcome! If you have any questions or issues, please open an issue in the repository. Enjoy building your to-do list application!
