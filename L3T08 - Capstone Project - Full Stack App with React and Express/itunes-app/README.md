# Media Search Application

This application consists of a frontend (my-app) built with React and a backend (backend) built with Node.js and Express. It allows users to search for media content from the iTunes API, view search results, and manage favorites.

### Installation

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Testing

To run tests for the frontend components:

```bash

```

## Backend (backend)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. The server will run on port 5000 by default. You can access the endpoints at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).


## Integration

Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running simultaneously for full functionality.
